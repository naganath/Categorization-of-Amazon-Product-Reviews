Aspect based sentiment analysis was done on the customer reviews from Amazon to categorize them based on the areas of the company     such as Packaging, Logistics, Quality, Specifications and Other operations in order to find the low performing areas of the company. 5-core     dataset of amazon reviews prepared by University of California was considered. Different deep learning models such as RNN, CNN and LSTM        were employed and compared to come up with best accuracy. GloVe model was used as pre-trained word embedding for the models.
